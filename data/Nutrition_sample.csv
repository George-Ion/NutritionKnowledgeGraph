Best Lemonade;This is from one of my  first Good House Keeping cookbooks.  You must use a *zester* in order to avoid getting any of that bitter rind, and when you zest the lemons, zest them onto some sugar from the recipe (the sugar will 'catch' all of the oils).  I also advise you from personal experience to use only the best skinned lemons for the best flavor.;Beverages;311.1;0.2;0.0;0.0;1.8;81.5;0.4;77.2;0.3

Buttermilk Pie;"This recipe was originally noted by my wife on a cooking show on TV.  It was touted as an Amish recipe.  All we had for a long time was the list of ingredients on the back of an old envelope.  We lost it for a good while and after I found it, I originally posted it so I would never lose it again.   Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost. Hey, it is a PIE, it is SUPPOSED to be sweet.  Enjoy";Pie;395.9;19.1;9.8;101.5;269.8;52.2;0.7;39.9;5.0

Black Bean, Corn, and Tomato Salad;"This is easy, delicious, colorful, delicious, uses currently-in-season fresh corn and tomatoes, and, oh yes, is really good.  I made a double batch of this yesterday for two of us, and we just polished off the rest of it this evening.    BTW, Ordinary tomato is fine instead of plum tomato (and we happen to use  more of it); I highly recommend flat-leaf parsley, if you can find it, because  the curly stuff is not nearly as flavorful; You can use radicchio or any other  kind of lettuce (if you choose to use any at all); The salad tastes even  better the second day!; Flavor is better when served closer to room temp  as opposed to ice cold.";Black Beans;407.8;15.4;2.3;0.0;20.0;55.8;16.6;4.3;17.1

Chicha Peruana;Chicha (corn beer). Chicha is made in South and, to a lesser extent, Central America. Unlike African opaque beer, it is not brewed commercially, but instead is made and served in what sound to me like wee tiny brewpubs. An abbreviated version is also made in people's kitchens. Chicha is consumed whilst still fermenting and so is low in alcohol. It is often spiced and may also be served with fruit.  With Bill's help and a little patience, a friend and I recently completed a batch. This was a very interesting and satisfying endeavour which included growing and malting the corn used. Every step of the process was very simple, and I highly recommend attempting this at home. My second crop of corn is about to come in and the results were good enough that I will be doing this again in the near future.;Beverages;21.1;0.3;0.0;0.0;3.6;2.7;1.5;0.0;2.7

Alfredo Sauce;"This is my son's favorite meal. I make it with shrimp for him for his birthday every year. GREAT for company because it is so easy and yet taste wonderful! I cook this in the microwave, but I'm sure you could do it on the stove too. Times are what work in my microwave. Please use your own good judgment on times to use in your microwave. (In my quest to eat healthier, I now make it with light butter, light cream and reduced fat Parmesan cheese. It still tastes wonderful, but there isn't any guilt!)
PLEASE NOTE! This is an &quot;authentic&quot; Alfredo sauce recipe! Real Alfredo sauce *only* contains butter, cream, Parmesan cheese and pepper. It will be thin and there is no garlic in it! If you want a thicker sauce or one with garlic like modern restaurants serve, please look elsewhere!

Chaat Masala;"Asafoetida, mango powder and black salt distinguish the chaat masala from other  masalas, giving the blend a sourness that makes it a welcome accompaniment to  fresh fruit and other snacks.    

&quot;Chaat&quot; refers to various snacks and to the North Indian cafes that serve them. 

Fresh fruit often is sprinkled with lime juice  and chaat masala.    

Black salt (which is actually a reddish gray), available at  Indian food stores, has a distinctive flavor that's quite different from sea salt or table salt.  

The garam masala is the wild card in this recipe; either one of  the Tamil Nadu Curry Powder or Punjabi-Style Garam Masala may be used.";Asian;125.3;6.9;0.5;0.0;13999.9;16.4;6.0;0.9;5.7

Easy Refrigerator Lemon Cookies;"This is my adopted recipe as of Feb 2005. I made these today and found very good. A very delicate cookie. I didn't leave enough room between the cookies in the first batch and they ran into each other when baking. They still taste good. The original poster describes below where she got the recipe.

The Lemon Lovers Cookbook The Chicago Sun-Times  Peg Bailey has a passion for lemons. Having lived  all over the world, Bailey is able to cull the best national dishes  from places such as Greece, Malta,  England, and her home in Virginia for The  Lemon Lovers Cookbook. The recipes  are never overly complicated, and most  are ideal for weekday cooking. Exotic  fare such as Aegean shrimp and  caviar mousse exist peacefully with all-American staples such as  carrot cake and lemon bars.   Easy Refrigerator Lemon Cookies  These cookies are great in the summer with a  bowl of fresh fruit. Plan ahead,  though, as you have to leave the dough in  the refrigerator for several hours  before baking.";Dessert;59.3;3.1;1.9;8.1;42.1;7.5;0.1;3.4;0.5

Zucchini Lasagna (Lasagne) - Low Carb;"Great for anyone going low carb OR who has so many zucchini, they don't know what to do!! :) We found the sauce to be very mild. I think it would be better with twice as much garlic. I boiled my zucchini slices for about 3 minutes so they were partially cooked. I wanted to make sure they were soft in the finished dish or I knew the kids wouldn't eat them. ;) The cottage cheese provides a slightly tangy note. I think we would have preferred ricotta, but that is personal taste. I use my 11x7 baking dish and got 6 pieces the size of what you see in my photos. Both of the guys ate two so it fed 4 of us, and I double the meat. Adjust the recipe accordingly for your family.";Vegetable;261.1;11.6;5.1;98.7;631.0;16.1;3.4;10.5;24.5

Some 'Berry' Good Fruit Dip Ideas!;FRUIT PLATTER A BERRY GOOD IDEA For many, the arrival of warm weather means a long-awaited supply of fresh - and varied - fruit. And whether you decide to pick your own or buy from a favorite roadside vendor, serving fruit with any meal is, well, a berry good idea. Not only do fruits make a colorful and flavorful accompaniment to breakfast, lunch or dinner, they make a refreshing and healthy snack in the middle of a hot day or under a welcoming shady tree on an outing with family or friends.  HELPFUL HINTS Storing berries: After selecting healthy-looking berries - you'll want to avoid bruised or moldy fruit of any kind - refrigerate them in a single layer, loosely covered. To freeze, arrange washed berries in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in freezer until solid. Transfer them to a plastic freezer bag or container, leaving half-an-inch at the top. Return to freezer.  Preparing a platter: You'll want at least three types of fruit for an attractive platter.;Fruit;1040.8;79.3;49.9;249.5;672.6;68.9;0.2;60.8;18.0

Here is what the original poster said about this recipe: &quot;You can take one of two approaches for the top crust here - a lattice top is more traditional and a little more work - the dough can be a little crumbly so you need to add a little water to roll it out.  You can skip the lattice and simply crumble the top crust dough over the jam and bake.  It will look more like a cobbler.  Either way will taste just fine!&quot;";Bar Cookie;235.4;8.3;5.0;35.8;202.1;38.2;0.7;17.0;2.7

Indian Onion Relish;I am trying to find out what ingredients are in the onion stuff that every Indian restaurant I've ever been to gives you to have with your meal. It's obviously diced onions, and it is a bright or deep red, sometimes even an orange color.  It's usually spicy hot to varying degrees, depending on the restaurant.  Thanks in advance!   Madhur Jaffrey's book _Indian Cooking_ describes this as being one of the relishes that may be served with almost every Indian meal, also familiar to people who dine in Indian restaurants.  Perhaps this is what you are looking for, but if not, you might try other Indian cookbooks for onion chutney recipes.  It should be under the condiments section.
